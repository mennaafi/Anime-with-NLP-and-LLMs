# Naruto series with NLP an LLMs

##### Welcome to the project ! , In this project, I will leverage AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and play with naruto anime series.

## All about data :
### In this project , I will use three datasets.

 
- subtitles : https://subtitlist.com/subs/naruto-season-1/english/2206507
- transcripts : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonzatrax/naruto-ep-1-transcript
- classification_dataset : https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Special:BrowseData/Jutsu?limit=250&offset=0&_cat=Jutsu

### Datasets Overview  

- **Subtitles Dataset:**  
  This comprehensive dataset contains subtitles for all episodes, making it ideal for training our **theme classification** and **named entity recognition** models. Its extensive size ensures rich insights can be extracted, powering **two models** in total.  

- **Transcripts Dataset:**  
  While this dataset is limited in size and does not encompass all episodes, it will still play a crucial role in our **chatbot** model. Despite this limitation, it offers valuable dialogue for character interactions, contributing to **one model**.  

- **Classification Dataset:**  
  This dataset will be crawled specifically to categorize ninja attacks into three distinct categories: **ninjutsu, genjutsu,** and **taijutsu**. This focused dataset will support the development of **one model** dedicated to classifying these attack types.

 > - ### I started by crawling a classification dataset from the Naruto Fandom website using `Scrapy and BeautifulSoup`. The focus was to extract detailed information about Jutsu, including their names, descriptions, and types of attacks.  












# Now Lets's start explain our Models  :






 ###   In this project, we have created 4 models, each containing the code for a different aspect of the project 

- `theme_classifier` :  is designed to classify themes from textual subtitles dataset which contains all episodes , using `a zero-shot learning` approach. Leveraging the pre-trained `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model from Hugging Face's Transformers library, this class allows for the identification of various themes based on user-defined categories.


#### Given this theme list :
  -  theme_list = ["friendship", "hope", "sacrifice", "battle", "self development", "betrayal", "love", "dialogue"] 
  - Model output    :

  - `named_entity_recognizer` :  focuses on identifying and extracting named entities, specifically person names, from a script. Utilizing the `spaCy` library and its transformer-based model `en_core_web_trf`, this model processes the text efficiently to enhance the overall understanding of character interactions within the scripts.  

  - `character_netowork_generator` : To understand the relationships between characters extracted by the `NamedEntityRecognizer`, the `CharacterNetworkGenerator` class helps visualize these connections through a network graph.  

  Together, the `NamedEntityRecognizer` and `CharacterNetworkGenerator` provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing character interactions in scripts. By extracting named entities and visualizing their relationships, this project enables a deeper understanding of character dynamics and story development, enriching the analysis of narratives within the datasets.

- `jutsu_classifier` :  is designed to classify types of `jutsu`, which are ninja attack categories from the Naruto franchise. It utilizes a pre-trained Transformer model, such as `DistilBERT`, to leverage advanced natural language processing techniques. `By fine-tuning` this model for the `specific task of jutsu classification`,  ensuring accurate classification of various jutsu types. 









- `character_chatbot` :
